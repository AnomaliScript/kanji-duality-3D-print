# Two-Sided Kanji print
You know those displays where if oou look at it from one perspective, it looks like one thing, but from another perspective, it looks like another thing?
This 3D print is basically that; when you look at it from the front, it's the kanji (one of the Japanese scripts) for "truth" (pronounced "jitsu"), and when looked at from the other side, it shows the kanji for "ideals" (pronounced "sou")

## Description
This print, like my other 3D print repos, was made in one day, but I still paid careful attention to detail, and I'll make adjustments to the CAD if needed, after printing it out and giving it a try
The reason I made this was to be able to take a cool photo where one light shines on one side, and another on the other side, and both kanji will be shown; it'll make for a pretty cool photo I think, right?
Also this "duality" between the meanings of the kanji is a subtle reference from Pokemon, specifically  (truth: Reshiram vs ideals: Zekrom)

## Installation
Download the file; it's as simple as that! (look up a tutorial on spicing stl files though if you don't know how to 3D print)
This file should be small enough to not require any external drives or hardware or whatever.

## Usage
It's a decorative piece thingy put it whereever you want, in whatever you want (within reason obviously).
I originally planned for it to be a prop for a photograph that I'm planning to take for a possible photography competition that may be coming up soon at my school.

## Features
It's designed to be free-standing (hopefully it is, I tried to allign their lower points)

## Contributing
You can make your own version of it!
Feel free to send me another version of the print if you make one that's better, or if you just have any more ideas to extend off of this print/CAD.
